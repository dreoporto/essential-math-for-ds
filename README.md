# Completed examples and exercises for *Essential Math for Data Science*

This repository contains completed examples and chapter exercises as part of my independent study of [Essential Math for Data Science](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/essential-math-for/9781098102920/) by Thomas Nield. 

In some cases, I have added to the code to assist my understanding of the material. A good example of this is the [Font Color Prediction exercise](./chapter_6_logistic_regression/chapter_6_exercises/ex_2_confusion_matrix.py) from *Chapter 6: Logistic Regression and Classification*.
